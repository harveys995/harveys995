My MSc project aims to build an EVM compatible DAPP (Decentralised Application) which is capable of using Blockchain Technology to verify product authenticity. This DAPP will utilize the ERC-721 Non-Fungible Token standard (NFT) to assign unique identifiers to each product sold on the platform When an item is sold, an NFT will be acquired alongside, therefore any product owner will be able link this NFT to the product listing if he/she decides to sell in the future. This association between product and NFT will be visible to all potential buyers and will enforce product authenticity. For more details on this project please get in contact!
