### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm an MSc Computer Science student at University of Birmingham, with a yearning to learn, problem solving mindset and confident approach to carry out any duty in a reliable, professional, and positive manner. My previous qualifications and work experiences relate to Physics & Energy Efficiency however, last year I decided to embark on postgraduate study in Computer Science, and this has remained one of my best decisions. Every part of this course has been enjoying and interesting and I cannot wait for when this MSc Degree leads to a job in Tech. One of the technologies that especially caught my attention is Blockchain. I strongly believe Blockchain can help empower the notion of complete transparency and will have a role in Enterprise. My aim is to work towards the adoption and development of Blockchain Technology and to further empower this, Iâ€™ll be dedicating my MSc project to creating an Ethereum based DAPP. For more information on this, please get in touch!
